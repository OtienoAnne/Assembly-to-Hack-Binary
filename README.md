# Assembly-to-Hack-Language
This is a simple python script that helps translate a file from assembly language to hack language.
The program utlizes the use of python dictionary to help the translation of c and a-instructions.
The General file.hack is the output file with the hack translation while the general test-file is the ouput of an intermediate file that is cleaner than the original file.

Testing
Once you have the general hack file, you can test it on the assembler.bat (Windows users) to check if your ouput is the same with the expected output.
Simply load any .asm file in bat, click the = sign for comparison and load your comparison file which is general.hack (the translation of the .asm file you loaded to assembler.bat) file
